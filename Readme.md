## Here I have implemented code for adding the guest in any event.
*you can change the **eventId** and **calendarID** if you want to add guest in another meeting.

## process to run the code
**cahnge the Event Id and Calendar Id to run the code for your calendar for your event.
* Go to setting tab of this sheet, 
* *click **add guest to an event**
*Enter Email Id of the guest
*Go to calendar where you have created that event, 
*see the guest list and you will see the entered email Id added in the guest list of that event in calendar.
